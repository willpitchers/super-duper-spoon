Genome-Wide Association Analysis using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel
===

I had built a number of pipelines for lab-mates & collaborators to do GWAS analysis using the DGRP lines, and found that I kept getting requests... This repo. is my attempt to generalize the scripts to make it easy for anyone to adapt for their own traits of interest/experimental design. If you find this useful please let me know.

The DGRP genotype data is available [**here**](http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu/data.html).
